## instructions for the hands-on session: 

you can run all the notebooks on a remote server (Method 1), **or** locally on your laptop (Method 2)

- Method 1) Run the notebooks on binder (remote server): 
 
  run the notebooks using this link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andreatramacere/Geneva_HighEnergy_Course_2022/HEAD)




- Method 2) Run the notebooks on your laptop: 
    
    In this case you have to clone the repo and install the code (**to avoid conflict in dependencies use python version in this range [3.8,3.9]**)

  -  The JetSeT installation instructions are here: https://jetset.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html

     The latest version will work with the version that we are using for the course, so you can use that documentation to get a feeling with the code

  
  
  
  - If you have problem with `conda` or `pip`  installation you can simply use the jetset installer code, hosted here: https://github.com/andreatramacere/ jetset-installer

    once you have cloned the repository, follow the instruction there and use this command line to install: ` python jetset_installer.py 1.2.1.post2`
